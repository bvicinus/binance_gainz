# Binance Unrealized Gains Calculator
- Because Binance was nice enough to not include any sort of calculator that tells you how much money you have made, in USD, throughout history, I decided to make a calculator for myself. 
- Feel free to open pull requests or submit feature requests. 
- This is **very much** a work in progress, and will be updated much more! 

## Planned features:
- Support for multiple different coins, besides BTC
- Support for liquid cash (in USD)
- Overall net gain 
- 24h net gain 
- Weekly net gain
- Dynamic date ranges

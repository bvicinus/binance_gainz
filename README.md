# Binance Unrealized Gains Calculator
- Because Binance was nice enough to not include any sort of calculator that tells you how much money you have made, in USD, throughout history, I decided to make a calculator for myself. 
- Feel free to open pull requests or submit feature requests. 
- This is **very much** a work in progress, and will be updated much more! 

## API Keys
- You will need to make a *free* account for an API key with *CoinMarketCap* [here](https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/)
